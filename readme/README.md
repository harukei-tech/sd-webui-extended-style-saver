## FAQ

### What does the zz- prefix mean?

Considering the compatibility with other extensions,
it was necessary for this extension to be loaded last.

For instance, to accommodate ControlNet,
it needs to be loaded after "sd-webui-controlnet".

The project name "extended-style-saver" couldn't accommodate this,
hence the prefix "zz" is attached at the beginning.
"sd-webui" is appended following the convention of other extensions.
